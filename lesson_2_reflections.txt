What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you create a .git paste in the folder that
stores old versions of the files in the folder(commits).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because
it is the transition between both, the files from the working directory are put there
and then send to the repository.
